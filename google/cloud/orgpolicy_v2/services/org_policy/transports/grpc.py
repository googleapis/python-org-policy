class OrgPolicyGrpcTransport(OrgPolicyTransport):
    """gRPC backend transport for OrgPolicy.

    An interface for managing organization policies.

    The Cloud Org Policy service provides a simple mechanism for
    organizations to restrict the allowed configurations across their
    entire Cloud Resource hierarchy.

    You can use a ``policy`` to configure restrictions in Cloud
    resources. For example, you can enforce a ``policy`` that restricts
    which Google Cloud Platform APIs can be activated in a certain part
    of your resource hierarchy, or prevents serial port access to VM
    instances in a particular folder.

    ``Policies`` are inherited down through the resource hierarchy. A
    ``policy`` applied to a parent resource automatically applies to all
    its child resources unless overridden with a ``policy`` lower in the
    hierarchy.

    A ``constraint`` defines an aspect of a resource's configuration
    that can be controlled by an organization's policy administrator.
    ``Policies`` are a collection of ``constraints`` that defines their
    allowable configuration on a particular resource and its child
    resources.

    This class defines the same methods as the primary client, so the
    primary client can load the underlying transport implementation
    and call it.

    It sends protocol buffers over the wire using gRPC (which is built on
    top of HTTP/2); the ``grpcio`` package must be installed.
