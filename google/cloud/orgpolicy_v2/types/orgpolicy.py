            An opaque tag indicating the current version of the
            ``Policy``, used for concurrency control.

            This field is ignored if used in a ``CreatePolicy`` request.

            When the ``Policy`` is returned from either a ``GetPolicy``
            or a ``ListPolicies`` request, this ``etag`` indicates the
            version of the current ``Policy`` to use when executing a
            read-modify-write loop.

            When the ``Policy`` is returned from a

            This represents the last time a call to ``CreatePolicy`` or

            Up to 10 PolicyRules are allowed.

            In Policies for boolean constraints, the following
            requirements apply:

            -  There must be one and only one PolicyRule where condition
               is unset.
            -  BooleanPolicyRules with conditions must set ``enforced``
               to the opposite of the PolicyRule without a condition.
            -  During policy evaluation, PolicyRules with conditions
               that are true for a target resource take precedence.
        inherit_from_parent (bool):
            Determines the inheritance behavior for this ``Policy``.

            If ``inherit_from_parent`` is true, PolicyRules set higher
            up in the hierarchy (up to the closest root) are inherited
            and present in the effective policy. If it is false, then no
            rules are inherited, and this Policy becomes the new root
            for evaluation. This field can be set only for Policies
            which configure list constraints.
        reset (bool):
            Ignores policies set above this resource and restores the
            ``constraint_default`` enforcement behavior of the specific
            ``Constraint`` at this resource. This field can be set in
            policies for either list or boolean constraints. If set,
            ``rules`` must be empty and ``inherit_from_parent`` must be
